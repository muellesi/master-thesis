\section{Hand pose estimation}
For the task of estimating the user's hand pose, we implement two different hand pose regressors and compare their performance. 

For both regressors, we use ImageNetV2 \cite{Sandler} as an encoder to transfer the given depth data into a latent feature space. 

\subsection{Structural training}
As described in the previous section, the hand pose module uses an encoder to convert the high-dimensional input data into a latent feature space. 
Using the principle of transfer learning, we can train the encoder separately in order to improve the overall performance of the pose regression network. 

For this we use an auto encoder-like structure as shown in Figure \ref{fig:autoencoder}.
