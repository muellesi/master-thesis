@article{DiWu2016,
 abstract = {This paper describes a novel method called Deep Dynamic Neural Networks (DDNN) for multimodal gesture recognition. A semi-supervised hierarchical dynamic framework based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed for simultaneous gesture segmentation and recognition where skeleton joint information, depth and RGB images, are the multimodal input observations. Unlike most traditional approaches that rely on the construction of complex handcrafted features, our approach learns high-level spatio-temporal representations using deep neural networks suited to the input modality: a Gaussian-Bernouilli Deep Belief Network (DBN) to handle skeletal dynamics, and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) to manage and fuse batches of depth and RGB images. This is achieved through the modeling and learning of the emission probabilities of the HMM required to infer the gesture sequence. This purely data driven approach achieves a Jaccard index score of 0.81 in the ChaLearn LAP gesture spotting challenge. The performance is on par with a variety of state-of-the-art hand-tuned feature-based approaches and other learning-based methods, therefore opening the door to the use of deep learning techniques in order to further explore multimodal time series data.},

@misc{GarciaHernando2017,
 abstract = {In this work we study the use of 3D hand poses to recognize first-person dynamic hand actions interacting with 3D objects. Towards this goal, we collected RGB-D video sequences comprised of more than 100K frames of 45 daily hand action categories, involving 26 different objects in several hand configurations. To obtain hand pose annotations, we used our own mo-cap system that automatically infers the 3D location of each of the 21 joints of a hand model via 6 magnetic sensors and inverse kinematics. Additionally, we recorded the 6D object poses and provide 3D object models for a subset of hand-object interaction sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark that enables the study of first-person hand actions with the use of 3D hand poses. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of RGB-D and pose-based action recognition by 18 baselines/state-of-the-art approaches. The impact of using appearance features, poses, and their combinations are measured, and the different training/testing protocols are evaluated. Finally, we assess how ready the 3D hand pose estimation field is when hands are severely occluded by objects in egocentric views and its influence on action recognition. From the results, we see clear benefits of using hand pose as a cue for action recognition compared to other data modalities. Our dataset and experiments can be of interest to communities of 3D hand pose estimation, 6D object pose, and robotics as well as action recognition.},

 abstract = {Articulated hand pose estimation plays an important role in human-computer interaction. Despite the recent progress, the accuracy of existing methods is still not satisfactory, partially due to the difficulty of embedded high-dimensional and non-linear regression problem. Different from the existing discriminative methods that regress for the hand pose with a single depth image, we propose to first project the query depth image onto three orthogonal planes and utilize these multi-view projections to regress for 2D heat-maps which estimate the joint positions on each plane. These multi-view heat-maps are then fused to produce final 3D hand pose estimation with learned pose priors. Experiments show that the proposed method largely outperforms state-of-the-art on a challenging dataset. Moreover, a cross-dataset experiment also demonstrates the good generalization ability of the proposed method.},

@article{Ge2019,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel method for real-time 3D hand pose estimation from single depth images using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Image-based features extracted by 2D CNNs are not directly suitable for 3D hand pose estimation due to the lack of 3D spatial information. Our proposed 3D CNN-based method, taking a 3D volumetric representation of the hand depth image as input and extracting 3D features from the volumetric input, can capture the 3D spatial structure of the hand and accurately regress full 3D hand pose in a single pass. In order to make the 3D CNN robust to variations in hand sizes and global orientations, we perform 3D data augmentation on the training data. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose applying the 3D deep network architectures and leveraging the complete hand surface as intermediate supervision for learning 3D hand pose from depth images. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art methods. A cross-dataset experiment also shows that our method has good generalization ability. Furthermore, our method is fast as our implementation runs at over 91 frames per second on a standard computer with a single GPU.},

@article{Hafiz2015,
 abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs), that allow processing complex-valued data directly, have been applied to a number of practical applications, especially in signal and image processing. In this paper, we apply CVNN as a classification algorithm for the skeletal wireframe data that are generated from hand gestures. A CVNN having one hidden layer that maps complex-valued input to real-valued output was used, a training algorithm based on Levenberg Marquardt algorithm (CLMA) was derived, and a task to recognize 26 different gestures that represent English alphabet was given. The initial image processing part consists of three modules: real-time hand tracking, hand-skeletal construction, and hand gesture recognition. We have achieved; (1) efficient and accurate gesture extraction and representation in complex domain, (2) training of the CVNN utilising CLMA, and (3) providing a proof of the superiority of the aforementioned methods by utilising complex-valued learning vector quantization. A comparison with real-valued neural network shows that a CVNN with CLMA provides higher recognition performance, accompanied by significantly faster training. Moreover, a comparison of six different activation functions was performed and their utility is argued.},

@misc{Hampali2019,
 abstract = {We propose a new dataset for 3D hand+object pose estimation from color images, together with a method for efficiently annotating this dataset, and a 3D pose prediction method based on this dataset. The current lack of training data makes the 3D hand+object pose estimation very challenging. This lack is due to the complexity of labeling many real images with both 3D poses and of generating synthetic images with various realistic interaction. Moreover, even if synthetic images could be used for training, annotated real images are still needed for validation. To tackle this challenge, we capture sequences with a simple setup made of a single RGB-D camera. We also use a color camera imaging the sequences from a side view, but only for validation. We introduce a novel method based on global optimization that exploits depth, color, and temporal constraints for efficiently annotating the sequences, which we use to train another novel method that predicts both the 3D poses of the hand and the object from a single color image. Our hope is to encourage other researchers to develop better annotation methods for our dataset: One can then apply such method to capture and easily annotate sequences captured with a single RGB-D camera to easily create additional training data thus solving one of the main problems of 3D hand+object pose estimation.},

 abstract = {The existence of large image datasets such as the set of photos on the World Wide Web make it

possible to build powerful generic models for low-level image attributes like color using simple histogram learning

techniques. We describe the construction of color models for skin and non-skin classes from a dataset of nearly

1 billion labelled pixels. These classes exhibit a surprising degree of separability which we exploit by building a skin

pixel detector achieving a detection rate of 80{\%} with 8.5{\%} false positives. We compare the performance of histogram

and mixture models in skin detection and ﬁnd histogram models to be superior in accuracy and computational cost.

Using aggregate features computed from the skin pixel detector we build a surprisingly effective detector for naked

people. Our results suggest that color can be a more powerful cue for detecting people in unconstrained imagery

than was previously suspected. We believe this work is the most comprehensive and detailed exploration of skin

color models to date.},

 abstract = {Hand segmentation for hand-object interaction is a necessary preprocessing step in many applications such as augmented reality, medical application, and human-robot interaction. However, typical methods are based on color information which is not robust to objects with skin color, skin pigment difference, and light condition variations. Thus, we propose hand segmentation method for hand-object interaction using only a depth map. It is challenging because of the small depth difference between a hand and objects during an interaction. To overcome this challenge, we propose the two-stage random decision forest (RDF) method consisting of detecting hands and segmenting hands. To validate the proposed method, we demonstrate results on the publicly available dataset of hand segmentation for hand-object interaction. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in short processing time comparing to the other state-of-the-art methods.},

 abstract = {Real-time recognition of dynamic hand gestures from video streams is a challenging task since (i) there is no indication when a gesture starts and ends in the video, (ii) performed gestures should only be recognized once, and (iii) the entire architecture should be designed considering the memory and power budget. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a hierarchical structure enabling offline-working convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to operate online efficiently by using sliding window approach. The proposed architecture consists of two models: (1) A detector which is a lightweight CNN architecture to detect gestures and (2) a classifier which is a deep CNN to classify the detected gestures. In order to evaluate the single-time activations of the detected gestures, we propose to use Levenshtein distance as an evaluation metric since it can measure misclassifications, multiple detections, and missing detections at the same time. We evaluate our architecture on two publicly available datasets - EgoGesture and NVIDIA Dynamic Hand Gesture Datasets - which require temporal detection and classification of the performed hand gestures. ResNeXt-101 model, which is used as a classifier, achieves the state-of-the-art offline classification accuracy of 94.04{\%} and 83.82{\%} for depth modality on EgoGesture and NVIDIA benchmarks, respectively. In real-time detection and classification, we obtain considerable early detections while achieving performances close to offline operation. The codes and pretrained models used in this work are publicly available.},

 abstract = {Computer vision system is one of the newest approaches for human computer interaction. Recently, the direct use of our hands as natural input devices has shown promising progress. Toward this progress, we introduce a hand gesture recognition system in this study to recognize real time gesture in unconstrained environments. The system consists of three components: real time hand tracking, hand-tree construction, and hand gesture recognition. Our main contribution includes: (1) a simple way to represent the hand gesture after applying thinning algorithm to the image, and (2) using a model of complex-valued neural network (CVNN) for real-valued classification. We have tested our system to 26 different gestures to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that the classification ability of single-layered CVNN on unseen data is comparable to the conventional real-valued neural network (RVNN) having one hidden layer. Moreover, convergence of the CVNN is much faster than that of the RVNN in most cases.},

 abstract = {Articulated hand pose estimation is a challenging task for human-computer interaction. The state-of-the-art hand pose estimation algorithms work only with one or a few subjects for which they have been calibrated or trained. Particularly, the hybrid methods based on learning followed by model fitting or model based deep learning do not explicitly consider varying hand shapes and sizes. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid algorithm for estimating the 3D hand pose as well as bone-lengths of the hand skeleton at the same time, from a single depth image. The proposed CNN architecture learns hand pose parameters and scale parameters associated with the bone-lengths simultaneously. Subsequently, a new hybrid forward kinematics layer employs both parameters to estimate 3D joint positions of the hand. For end-to-end training, we combine three public datasets NYU, ICVL and MSRA-2015 in one unified format to achieve large variation in hand shapes and sizes. Among hybrid methods, our method shows improved accuracy over the state-of-the-art on the combined dataset and the ICVL dataset that contain multiple subjects. Also, our algorithm is demonstrated to work well with unseen images.},

 abstract = {Articulated hand pose and shape estimation is an important problem for vision-based applications such as augmented reality and animation. In contrast to the existing methods which optimize only for joint positions, we propose a fully supervised deep network which learns to jointly estimate a full 3D hand mesh representation and pose from a single depth image. To this end, a CNN architecture is employed to estimate parametric representations i.e. hand pose, bone scales and complex shape parameters. Then, a novel hand pose and shape layer, embedded inside our deep framework, produces 3D joint positions and hand mesh. Lack of sufficient training data with varying hand shapes limits the generalized performance of learning based methods. Also, manually annotating real data is suboptimal. Therefore, we present SynHand5M: a million-scale synthetic dataset with accurate joint annotations, segmentation masks and mesh files of depth maps. Among model based learning (hybrid) methods, we show improved results on our dataset and two of the public benchmarks i.e. NYU and ICVL. Also, by employing a joint training strategy with real and synthetic data, we recover 3D hand mesh and pose from real images in 3.7ms.},

 abstract = {Tracking the full skeletal pose of the hands and fingers is a challenging problem that has a plethora of applications for user interaction. Existing techniques either require wearable hardware, add restrictions to user pose, or require significant computation resources. This research explores a new approach to tracking hands, or any articulated model, by using an augmented rigid body simulation. This allows us to phrase 3D object tracking as a linear complementarity problem with a well-defined solution. Based on a depth sensor's samples, the system generates constraints that limit motion orthogonal to the rigid body model's surface. These constraints, along with prior motion, collision/contact constraints, and joint mechanics, are resolved with a projected Gauss-Seidel solver. Due to camera noise properties and attachment errors, the numerous surface constraints are impulse capped to avoid overpowering mechanical constraints. To improve tracking accuracy, multiple simulations are spawned at each frame and fed a variety of heuristics, constraints and poses. A 3D error metric selects the best-fit simulation, helping the system handle challenging hand motions. Such an approach enables real-time, robust, and accurate 3D skeletal tracking of a user's hand on a variety of depth cameras, while only utilizing a single x86 CPU core for processing.},

@misc{Simon2017,
 abstract = {We present an approach that uses a multi-camera system to train fine-grained detectors for keypoints that are prone to occlusion, such as the joints of a hand. We call this procedure multiview bootstrapping: first, an initial keypoint detector is used to produce noisy labels in multiple views of the hand. The noisy detections are then triangulated in 3D using multiview geometry or marked as outliers. Finally, the reprojected triangulations are used as new labeled training data to improve the detector. We repeat this process, generating more labeled data in each iteration. We derive a result analytically relating the minimum number of views to achieve target true and false positive rates for a given detector. The method is used to train a hand keypoint detector for single images. The resulting keypoint detector runs in realtime on RGB images and has accuracy comparable to methods that use depth sensors. The single view detector, triangulated over multiple views, enables 3D markerless hand motion capture with complex object interactions.},

In this paper, we propose a learning framework using static, dynamic and sequential mixed features to solve three fundamental problems: spatial domain variation, temporal domain polytrope, and intra- and inter-class diversities. Utilizing a cognitive-based data reduction method and a hybrid {\textquotedbl}network upon networks{\textquotedbl} architecture, we extract human action representations which are robust against spatial and temporal interferences and adaptive to variations in both action speed and duration. We evaluated our method on the UCF101 and other three challenging datasets. Our results demonstrated a superior performance of the proposed algorithm in human action recognition.},

 abstract = {In this paper we introduce a large-scale hand pose dataset, collected using a novel capture method. Existing datasets are either generated synthetically or captured using depth sensors: synthetic datasets exhibit a certain level of appearance difference from real depth images, and real datasets are limited in quantity and coverage, mainly due to the difficulty to annotate them. We propose a tracking system with six 6D magnetic sensors and inverse kinematics to automatically obtain 21-joints hand pose annotations of depth maps captured with minimal restriction on the range of motion. The capture protocol aims to fully cover the natural hand pose space. As shown in embedding plots, the new dataset exhibits a significantly wider and denser range of hand poses compared to existing benchmarks. Current state-of-the-art methods are evaluated on the dataset, and we demonstrate significant improvements in cross-benchmark performance. We also show significant improvements in egocentric hand pose estimation with a CNN trained on the new dataset.},

Following the successful Hands In the Million Challenge (HIM2017), we investigate the top 10 state-of-the-art methods on three tasks: single frame 3D pose estimation, 3D hand tracking, and hand pose estimation during object interaction. We analyze the performance of different CNN structures with regard to hand shape, joint visibility, view point and articulation distributions. Our findings include: (1) isolated 3D hand pose estimation achieves low mean errors (10 mm) in the view point range of [70, 120] degrees, but it is far from being solved for extreme view points; (2) 3D volumetric representations outperform 2D CNNs, better capturing the spatial structure of the depth data; (3) Discriminative methods still generalize poorly to unseen hand shapes; (4) While joint occlusions pose a challenge for most methods, explicit modeling of structure constraints can significantly narrow the gap between errors on visible and occluded joints.},

 abstract = {We present the 2017 Hands in the Million Challenge, a public competition designed for the evaluation of the task of 3D hand pose estimation. The goal of this challenge is to assess how far is the state of the art in terms of solving the problem of 3D hand pose estimation as well as detect major failure and strength modes of both systems and evaluation metrics that can help to identify future research directions. The challenge follows up the recent publication of BigHand2.2M and First-Person Hand Action datasets, which have been designed to exhaustively cover multiple hand, viewpoint, hand articulation, and occlusion. The challenge consists of a standardized dataset, an evaluation protocol for two different tasks, and a public competition. In this document we describe the different aspects of the challenge and, jointly with the results of the participants, it will be presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Observing and Understanding Hands in Action, HANDS 2017, with ICCV 2017.},

@misc{Yuan2018,
 abstract = {This paper proposes a method for hand pose estimation from RGB images that uses both external large-scale depth image datasets and paired depth and RGB images as privileged information at training time. We show that providing depth information during training significantly improves performance of pose estimation from RGB images during testing. We explore different ways of using this privileged information: (1) using depth data to initially train a depth-based network, (2) using the features from the depth-based network of the paired depth images to constrain mid-level RGB network weights, and (3) using the foreground mask, obtained from the depth data, to suppress the responses from the background area. By using paired RGB and depth images, we are able to supervise the RGB-based network to learn middle layer features that mimic that of the corresponding depth-based network, which is trained on large-scale, accurately annotated depth data. During testing, when only an RGB image is available, our method produces accurate 3D hand pose predictions. Our method is also tested on 2D hand pose estimation. Experiments on three public datasets show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for hand pose estimation using RGB image input.},

@misc{Zhang2016,
 abstract = {3D hand pose tracking/estimation will be very important in the next generation of human-computer interaction. Most of the currently available algorithms rely on low-cost active depth sensors. However, these sensors can be easily interfered by other active sources and require relatively high power consumption. As a result, they are currently not suitable for outdoor environments and mobile devices. This paper aims at tracking/estimating hand poses using passive stereo which avoids these limitations. A benchmark with 18,000 stereo image pairs and 18,000 depth images captured from different scenarios and the ground-truth 3D positions of palm and finger joints (obtained from the manual label) is thus proposed. This paper demonstrates that the performance of the state-of-the art tracking/estimation algorithms can be maintained with most stereo matching algorithms on the proposed benchmark, as long as the hand segmentation is correct. As a result, a novel stereo-based hand segmentation algorithm specially designed for hand tracking/estimation is proposed. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the state-of-the-art hand pose tracking/estimation algorithms and the tracking quality is comparable to the use of active depth sensors under different challenging scenarios.},

@misc{Zimmermann2017,
 abstract = {Low-cost consumer depth cameras and deep learning have enabled reasonable 3D hand pose estimation from single depth images. In this paper, we present an approach that estimates 3D hand pose from regular RGB images. This task has far more ambiguities due to the missing depth information. To this end, we propose a deep network that learns a network-implicit 3D articulation prior. Together with detected keypoints in the images, this network yields good estimates of the 3D pose. We introduce a large scale 3D hand pose dataset based on synthetic hand models for training the involved networks. Experiments on a variety of test sets, including one on sign language recognition, demonstrate the feasibility of 3D hand pose estimation on single color images.},
